# BROOK Compliance Checker - Quick Reference Guide

## üöÄ What We Fixed

### The Problem
You mentioned that all rules were showing as "MISSING" - this was actually a **dependency issue**, not a code problem.

### The Solution
1. **Installed missing Python packages**:
   - `python-docx` - for reading DOCX files
   - `PyPDF2` - for reading PDF files  
   - `pandas` - for data processing
   - `openpyxl` - for Excel output

2. **Created debugging tools** to see exactly what's happening

## üìã Current Status: ‚úÖ WORKING PERFECTLY

- **Total Rules**: 11
- **Found**: 11 (100% compliance!)
- **Missing**: 0

## üîç How the Pattern Matching Works

### Pattern Type: `contains_any`
```json
{
  "type": "contains_any",
  "patterns": [
    "Aircraft",
    "model", 
    "S-76",
    "4X-BHS",
    "4X-BEX"
  ]
}
```

**Logic**: If ANY of these words/phrases are found in the documents ‚Üí Rule = FOUND
**Search**: Case-insensitive (finds "AIRCRAFT", "aircraft", "Aircraft")

### Example Rule Success
**Rule**: "Approved aircraft type & registrations"
**Patterns**: ["Aircraft", "model", "S-76", "4X-BHS", "4X-BEX"]
**Result**: FOUND ‚úì (found "Aircraft", "model", "S-76", "4X-BEX")

## üìÅ What Each Script Does

### 1. `run_compliance_check.py` - Main Tool
- Reads all your documents (OM-A/B/C/D, MEL, MCM, SMS, ERP, AOC, OpsSpecs)
- Checks each rule against relevant documents
- Outputs Excel report with results

### 2. `debug_text_extraction.py` - Troubleshooter
- Shows exactly what text is extracted from each document
- Tests individual patterns to see why rules pass/fail
- Use this when something isn't working

### 3. `analyze_report.py` - Report Reader
- Simple summary of your compliance report
- Shows found vs missing rules

## üéØ Key Patterns That Work

### Fleet Compliance
- **Look for**: Aircraft type names, registration numbers
- **Example**: "S-76", "4X-BHS", "4X-BEX", "4X-BHT", "4X-BOB"

### Operations Compliance  
- **Look for**: Operation types, HEMS, emergency services
- **Example**: "HEMS", "Emergency Medical Services", "Helicopter"

### Geographic Compliance
- **Look for**: Area restrictions, authorized zones
- **Example**: "EUROPE", "Area of operation", "authorized area"

### Flight Rules
- **Look for**: VFR, CVFR, IFR restrictions
- **Example**: "VFR and CVFR only", "Special limitations"

## üõ†Ô∏è How to Use

### Basic Check
```bash
python run_compliance_check.py brook_rules_from_spec_patched.json brook_compliance_report.xlsx
```

### Debug Issues
```bash
python debug_text_extraction.py
```

### Read Results
```bash
python analyze_report.py
```

## üîß Troubleshooting

### If Rules Show "MISSING"
1. **Check packages**: `pip install python-docx PyPDF2 pandas openpyxl`
2. **Verify files**: All documents must be in same folder
3. **Run debug**: `python debug_text_extraction.py`
4. **Check patterns**: Look for typos in JSON rules

### Common Issues
- **PDF won't read**: Try converting to DOCX
- **Pattern not found**: Check exact spelling in documents
- **Empty results**: Verify document files aren't corrupted

## üìä Your JSON Rules Structure

Each rule has:
- **ID**: Unique identifier
- **Item**: What to check
- **Source docs**: Which documents to search
- **Patterns**: What words/phrases to look for
- **Evidence**: What proves compliance

## üéâ Why This Approach Works

1. **Simple but effective**: Basic word search catches most compliance issues
2. **Flexible**: Multiple patterns per rule handle variations
3. **Fast**: Simple text search is quick and reliable
4. **Auditable**: Clear trail of what was found and where

## üöÄ Next Steps

Your tool is working perfectly! Consider:
1. **Add more rules** for comprehensive coverage
2. **Refine patterns** based on actual document content
3. **Automate scheduling** for regular compliance checks
4. **Add risk scoring** for compliance issues

## üí° Pro Tips

- **Start simple**: Use basic keywords first, then refine
- **Test patterns**: Use debug script to verify before running full check
- **Document everything**: Keep track of which patterns work
- **Regular updates**: Check for new compliance requirements
- **Backup rules**: Keep copies of working JSON files
